# Implementation Handoff

## Active Prototype Files

The runnable entry and live prototype files are:

- `WNF.xcodeproj` / `WNF/`：native SwiftUI iOS implementation of the current app design.
- `.xcodebuildmcp/config.yaml`：persisted XcodeBuildMCP defaults for the native app, including project, scheme, simulator, and bundle id.
- `index.html`：implemented static app shell. It renders the actual product screens, keeps the iPhone frame as the primary surface, exposes desktop/mobile control panels, persists local state, and links back to the handoff docs.
- `窝囊费.html`：entry shell, tweak state, iPhone frame, three core screens and comparison boards.
- `wonangfei.html`：same entry shell copied with an ASCII filename for safer handoff.
- `shared.jsx`：theme tokens, money/time math, reusable UI primitives.
- `home.jsx`：single-screen home hero.
- `stats.jsx`：interactive record page.
- `settings.jsx`：interactive settings/profile page.
- `cow.jsx`：8-pose mascot helper.
- `ios-frame.jsx`：status bar and device chrome support.
- `design-canvas.jsx`：Open Design preview canvas and artboards.
- `tweaks-panel.jsx`：internal preview controls.

Current `main` note: commits after `bdaa6ef` reverted the earlier widget/persistence split. The active native implementation is the single `WNF/` app target with settings state in `WNF/WageState.swift`; there is no current `WNFWidget/`, `WageCore.swift`, or `WageDisplayModel.swift` in this checkout.

## Native Onboarding

Source: `WNF/OnboardingView.swift`

- Four pages: app framing, salary setup, work/lunch setup, completion summary.
- Page 1 uses a dedicated intro layout with a taller `OnboardingP1` hero and no accessory hint card; pages 2-4 keep the compact hero plus setup/summary card pattern.
- `OnboardingImageStore` preloads and prepares hero images off the main path before display.
- `OnboardingImagePanel` handles static hero rendering for pages 1, 2, and 4.
- `LunchImagePanel` crossfades page 3 between `OnboardingLunchSleep` and `OnboardingLunchWake` based on `WageState.hasLunchBreak`.
- `OnboardingP1`, `OnboardingP2`, `OnboardingLunchSleep`, `OnboardingLunchWake`, and `OnboardingP4` are all asset-catalog image names. Their PNG files live under `WNF/Assets.xcassets`.

Hero asset mapping from the local material folder:

| Source file | App asset |
|---|---|
| `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/p1.png` | `WNF/Assets.xcassets/OnboardingP1.imageset/onboarding-p1.png` |
| `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/p2.png` | `WNF/Assets.xcassets/OnboardingP2.imageset/onboarding-p2.png` |
| `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/p3午休.png` | `WNF/Assets.xcassets/OnboardingLunchSleep.imageset/onboarding-lunch-sleep.png` |
| `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/p3睡醒.png` | `WNF/Assets.xcassets/OnboardingLunchWake.imageset/onboarding-lunch-wake.png` |
| `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/p4.png` | `WNF/Assets.xcassets/OnboardingP4.imageset/onboarding-p4.png` |

All five target PNGs are expected to remain `1536 x 1024` with `hasAlpha: yes`. Before handing off a replacement, compare source/target hashes when possible and run `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight -g hasAlpha` on the target asset-catalog files.

## Core State

Default app state lives in `窝囊费.html` under `TWEAK_DEFAULTS`:

- `monthlySalary`: 18000
- `workdaysPerMonth`: 26
- `workStart`: `09:30`
- `workEnd`: `18:30`
- `lunchStart`: `12:00`
- `lunchEnd`: `13:00`
- `noLunch`: false
- `weekdays`: `[0,1,2,3,4]`
- `overtime`: true
- `privacy`: false
- `nowTime`: `15:24`

## Salary Math

Source: `shared.jsx -> computeDay(cfg, nowMin)`

1. Parse work start/end and lunch start/end as minutes.
2. If `cfg.noLunch` is true, set lunch start and lunch end to end time.
3. Compute paid workday minutes:
   - `workdayLen = workEnd - workStart - lunchLen`
4. Compute hourly rate:
   - `hourlyRate = monthlySalary / (workdaysPerMonth * (workdayLen / 60))`
5. Compute elapsed paid minutes up to `nowMin`, subtracting lunch overlap.
6. Compute current-day earnings:
   - `earnedToday = hourlyRate / 60 * elapsedPaid`

Important: the settings UI label says `午休`. Switch on means "has lunch break"; switch off means "没有午休". The data flag remains `noLunch`.

## Interaction Requirements

### 全局 Tab

- 底部 `首页 / 记录 / 我的` tab 使用自定义 SwiftUI `AppTabBar`。
- 切换 tab 时，主内容按 tab 顺序做横向滑入/滑出并叠加淡入淡出：向右侧 tab 前进时新页面从右进入，返回左侧 tab 时新页面从左进入。
- 底部胶囊选中态和页面内容过渡共用同一次 `snappy` 动画。

### 引导页

- First launch shows the four-screen onboarding flow before the main tab UI.
- Header title changes per page and the skip button moves directly to the final page before completion.
- Page 2 salary controls commit through `WageState`.
- Page 3 work time and lunch controls update the same settings state used by the main app.
- Page 3 hero crossfades between the lunch sleep/wake assets when 午休 is toggled.

### 首页

- Top-right action opens the share card; it no longer toggles privacy on the home page.
- Opening the share card blurs the existing home content and adds a full-bleed dimmed overlay that covers the status bar and bottom home-indicator areas.
- `RootView` owns the stable full-screen backdrop, share card presentation, and export sheet so the dimmed safe-area coverage does not depend on the card transition or tab-content transition; `HomeView` only requests presentation and blurs its own home content while the card is open.
- Share card presentation uses opacity-only insertion/removal so the card bounds stay fixed throughout the transition.
- Share card content must include `今日窝囊费` and `上班上了多久`.
- Share card title/subtitle copy is selected from `ShareCardCopy.pool` every time the home share action opens the card. The picker excludes the currently displayed pair when possible, so repeated opens visibly refresh the wording.
- Share card controls:
  - eye button masks/unmasks card-sensitive values only;
  - share button renders the card without controls and presents iOS `UIActivityViewController`;
  - x button closes the card.
- Tapping outside the card closes the card. While the card is open, bottom tab bar interaction is disabled.

### 记录页

- 周 / 月 / 年 tabs must switch datasets.
- Chart bars must be tappable except future bars.
- Selected chart bar must show a callout and can be cleared.
- Privacy toggle must mask all money strings with dot placeholders.
- Hero total must recompute from salary/workday/lunch settings.

### 我的页

- Salary and monthly-workday rows use a shared SwiftUI value stepper: `- / +` buttons handle precise increments, and tapping the center value opens a numeric quick-entry alert.
- Salary quick entry accepts digits and clamps to `0...100000`; salary step controls change in increments of 500.
- Monthly workdays quick entry accepts digits and clamps to `1...31`; monthly workday step controls change in increments of 1.
- Weekday pills toggle active state.
- Time controls use native time input.
- 午休 switch hides/reveals lunch rows and recomputes hourly rate.
- 计入加班 is the only interactive switch in the 其它 section.

## Visual Implementation Rules

- Use `#FFF6E5` as the app background, not plain white.
- Use `#FFC83D` only for brand anchors, active chart bars, active switch knobs, and selected states.
- Use `#0D0D0D` for primary action surfaces, selected chart states, and high-emphasis typography.
- Keep borders at `0.5px` hairlines.
- Use rounded corners intentionally:
  - 10-12px for controls.
  - 18px for thumbnails.
  - 22px for standard cards.
  - 28px for hero cards.
  - 999px for pills.
- Numbers should use JetBrains Mono or platform mono with tabular numerics.
- Do not use emoji as feature icons; use the current stroked SVG icon language.

## Hand-off Notes

- Native iOS entry: open `WNF.xcodeproj`, scheme `WNF`, bundle id `com.wonangfei.app`, iOS deployment target `17.0`.
- Current simulator validation used `iPhone 17` on iOS `26.5`; `build_sim` and `build_run_sim` both succeeded with no diagnostics.
- XcodeBuildMCP defaults are committed under `.xcodebuildmcp/config.yaml`, so agents can call `build_sim`, `build_run_sim`, `snapshot_ui`, `tap`, and `screenshot` without re-entering project defaults.
- 2026-05-17 onboarding hero replacement validation: five source PNGs from `/Users/shelingzhao/Documents/窝囊费素材/引导/` matched their target asset-catalog SHA-256 hashes, all target files reported `1536 x 1024` and `hasAlpha: yes`, and `build_sim` succeeded.
- Home share card verification covered opening the card, masking sensitive values, presenting the iOS share sheet, closing with the x button, and closing by tapping outside the card.
- The source prototype still includes Open Design canvas and tweak controls. For production, move only the screen components and shared tokens into the app shell.
- `assets/reference-screens/` contains visual inputs and may include duplicate imported versions. Treat it as reference material, not production bundle.
- `assets/mascot/hero-mascot.png` is currently used in both record achievement card and settings profile banner.
- The root app fixes the package asset paths through `WNF_MASCOT_ROOT`, so the same screen components work from both `/index.html` and `/assets/source/wonangfei.html`.
- The old 8-pose cow set remains useful for home screen state changes.
